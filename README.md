## Glossary of Unicode Terms

**Byte Order Mark**  
 - The Unicode character U+FEFF when used to indicate the byte order of a text. (See Section 2.13, Special Characters and Noncharacters, and Section 23.8, Specials.)

**Code Page** 
 - A coded character set, often referring to a coded character set used by a personal computerâ€”for example, PC code page 437, the default coded character set used by the U.S. English version of the DOS operating system.

**Code Point** 
 - Any value in the Unicode codespace; that is, the range of integers from 0 to 10FFFF16. (See definition D10 in Section 3.4, Characters and Encoding.) Not all code points are assigned to encoded characters. See code point type. 
 - A value, or position, for a character, in any coded character set.

**Code Position** 
 - Synonym for code point. Used in ISO character encoding standards.

**Codespace** 
 - A range of numerical values available for encoding characters. 
 - For the Unicode Standard, a range of integers from 0 to 10FFFF16. (See definition D9 in Section 3.4, Characters and Encoding.)

**Code Unit** 
 - The minimal bit combination that can represent a unit of encoded text for processing or interchange. The Unicode Standard uses 8-bit code units in the UTF-8 encoding form, 16-bit code units in the UTF-16 encoding form, and 32-bit code units in the UTF-32 encoding form. (See definition D77 in Section 3.9, Unicode Encoding Forms.)
